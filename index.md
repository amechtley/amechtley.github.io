# About Me

I have been a developer in the games industry since 2004. I am currently a software developer at [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), where I am working on our new [data-oriented tech stack](https://unity.com/dots).

I am also trained as a learning scientist. My academic work has focused on design-based research related to epistemic cognition, argumentation, and learning in science- and engineering-based computer and board games.
